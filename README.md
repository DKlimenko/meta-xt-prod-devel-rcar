# meta-xt-prod-devel-rcar #

This repository contains Renesas RCAR Gen3-specific Yocto layers for
Xen Troops distro. Layers in this repository provide final recipes to
build meta-xt-prod-devel distro. This distro is the main Xen Troops
product, that we use to develop and integrate new features

Those layers *may* be added and used manually, but they were written
with [Moulin](https://moulin.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) build system,
as Moulin-based project files provide correct entries in local.conf
